## The Problem

Your AI tools need configuration — AGENTS.md, skills, rules, MCP configs. Today:

- **They're copy-pasted everywhere.** The same AGENTS.md lives in 12 repos. Each copy drifts independently.
- **They clutter git.** Every AI tool wants its own config files. That's 10+ files committed to every repo, creating PR noise and merge conflicts.
- **Onboarding is manual.** New person joins. "Copy these files from the wiki." They miss one. Their AI gives bad advice.
- **Cleanup is impossible.** You tried an experimental AI config. Now you have to find and delete 6 files across 3 tool directories — and hope you didn't miss one.

## The Fix

Keep your AI config in **one git repo** (a registry). csaw **symlinks** it into your projects. Update the registry, every project sees the change instantly. Unmount, and it's like csaw was never there.

```
your-registry/                         your-project/
  AGENTS.md                     ──→      AGENTS.md (symlink)
  rules/                                 .claude/rules/
    go-conventions.md           ──→        go-conventions.md (symlink)
  agents/                                .claude/agents/
    code-reviewer.md            ──→        code-reviewer.md (symlink)
  skills/                                .claude/skills/
    code-review/SKILL.md        ──→        code-review/SKILL.md (symlink)
  mcp/                                   .mcp.json (symlink)
    claude-code.json            ──→
```

Nothing is committed to your project. Git never sees the files. Unmount, and they're gone.

## Starting a New Project

You have a brand new repo with no AI config. Create a personal registry:

```bash
csaw init ~/my-ai-config
```

```
✔ initialized registry "my-ai-config"

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Register as a source?                              │
│  ▸ Yes       No                                     │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✔ registered source "my-ai-config" with priority 10
```

This creates a ready-to-use registry:

```
~/my-ai-config/
  csaw.yml              ← default profile
  AGENTS.md             ← your coding rules
  skills/
    code-review/SKILL.md
    commit-message/SKILL.md
```

Now mount it into your project:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
csaw mount --profile my-ai-config/default
```

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│                                                  │
│  mounted                                         │
│                                                  │
│  my-ai-config                                    │
│   ✔ AGENTS.md                                    │
│   ✔ .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md          │
│   ✔ .claude/skills/commit-message/SKILL.md       │
│                                                  │
│  3 files mounted · 1 tool dirs                   │
│                                                  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Your project now looks like this:

```
my-project/
  src/
  package.json
  AGENTS.md                              ← symlink to ~/my-ai-config/AGENTS.md
  .claude/
    skills/
      code-review/SKILL.md               ← symlink
      commit-message/SKILL.md            ← symlink
```

Open Claude Code (or Cursor, Codex, Copilot) — it finds the files automatically. Run `git status` — nothing shows up. The files are hidden via `.git/info/exclude`.

---

## I Already Have an AGENTS.md

You have an existing project with AI config files scattered around — an AGENTS.md, maybe some skills in `.claude/skills/`. You want to pull them into a registry instead of leaving them committed.

```bash
cd ~/my-project
csaw init --adopt ~/my-ai-config
```

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────╮
│                                       │
│  adopted 3 files                      │
│                                       │
│   ✔ AGENTS.md                         │
│   ✔ skills/testing/SKILL.md           │
│   ✔ agents/go.md                      │
│                                       │
╰───────────────────────────────────────╯
```

csaw scans your project, finds AI config files, and copies them into the new registry with the correct structure. It reverses the projection — `.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md` becomes `skills/testing/SKILL.md` in the registry, `.claude/rules/go.md` becomes `agents/go.md`.

Now you can delete the originals from your project, register the source, and mount instead:

```bash
csaw source add personal ~/my-ai-config --priority 10
csaw mount --profile personal/default
```

---

## Mounting a Team Source

Your team keeps shared AI config in a git repo. One command to get it:

```bash
csaw source add team git@github.com:your-org/ai-config.git
```

```
✔ registered source "team"
✔ cloned team
```

csaw auto-clones the repo. Now mount:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
csaw mount --profile team/backend
```

Your project gets the team's AGENTS.md, skills, and rules — all symlinked. Every repo on the team mounts the same source. When someone updates the team config:

```bash
csaw pull team
# ✔ pulled team
```

Every project sees the update instantly through the symlinks. No re-mounting needed.

---

## Having Your Own Config Alongside the Team

You want the team's shared config **plus** your personal preferences. Create a personal registry:

```bash
csaw init ~/my-ai-config
csaw source add personal ~/my-ai-config --priority 10
```

Now you have two sources. Mount uses both:

```bash
csaw mount --profile team/backend
```

If personal has `skills/debug-strategy/SKILL.md` and team has `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, **both** get mounted — they're different files, no conflict.

### What if both have the same file?

If both personal and team provide `AGENTS.md`, **priority decides**. Personal has priority 10, team has priority 0 (default). Personal wins.

```bash
csaw inspect
```

```
Sources
  personal (local, priority 10) → ~/my-ai-config
  team (remote) → ~/.csaw/sources/team
```

You can set priority on any source:

```bash
csaw source add team git@github.com:org/config.git --priority 0
csaw source add personal ~/my-config --priority 10     # wins on conflicts
```

Higher number wins. If two sources have the same priority and provide the same file, csaw errors and tells you to resolve it.

---

## Experimental Skills

Working on a new skill? Put it in `skills/experimental/`:

```
~/my-ai-config/
  skills/
    code-review/SKILL.md         ← stable, always mounted
    experimental/
      debug-strategy/SKILL.md    ← hidden from default mounts
```

The `.csawignore` file hides `skills/experimental/**` by default. To test an experimental skill:

```bash
csaw mount --profile personal/default --include-experimental
```

When you're confident it works, promote it:

```bash
csaw promote personal/skills/experimental/debug-strategy
# ✔ promoted debug-strategy from experimental to stable
#   Push: csaw push personal -m "promote debug-strategy"
```

This moves it from `skills/experimental/debug-strategy/` to `skills/debug-strategy/` — now it mounts by default.

To share a promoted skill with the team:

```bash
csaw fork personal/skills/debug-strategy/SKILL.md --into team
csaw push team -m "add debug-strategy skill"
```

---

## Pulling Team Updates

A teammate updated the team's AGENTS.md. Get the latest:

```bash
csaw pull team
# ✔ pulled team
```

Since your project's `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to the team registry, the update is visible instantly — no remount needed.

### What if I edited a mounted file?

If you edited `AGENTS.md` in your project, you actually edited the team registry (through the symlink). Now `csaw pull` detects uncommitted changes:

```
! team has uncommitted changes
  Commit:  cd ~/.csaw/sources/team && git add -A && git commit -m "..."
  Or stash: csaw pull team --stash
```

**`--stash`** stashes your changes, pulls, then pops the stash:

```bash
csaw pull team --stash
# ✔ pulled team
```

### What if the team and I changed the same file?

If you have local commits and the remote has diverged:

```
! team has diverged (2 local, 5 remote commits)
  Resolve: cd ~/.csaw/sources/team && git pull --rebase
```

This is standard git — csaw tells you what happened and where to fix it. The registry is a normal git repo.

---

## Sharing Your Changes

You updated a skill through a symlink (or edited the registry directly). Push it:

```bash
csaw push team -m "improve code review skill"
# ✔ pushed team
```

This runs `git add -A && git commit && git push` in the team registry. Your teammates pull the update with `csaw pull`.

If you're not sure and want to go through a PR instead:

```bash
csaw source clone team ~/Developer/team-config
cd ~/Developer/team-config
git checkout -b improve-code-review
# ... edit files ...
git add -A && git commit -m "improve code review"
git push -u origin improve-code-review
gh pr create
```

`csaw source clone` moves a remote source to a local directory for contribution. Now you can branch, PR, and collaborate like any codebase.

---

## Testing a Branch

You want to try a feature branch of the team config without affecting other projects:

```bash
csaw pin team@feature/new-rules
csaw pull team
csaw mount --profile team/backend
```

This project now uses the `feature/new-rules` branch. Other projects stay on main. When you're done:

```bash
csaw unpin team
csaw pull team
```

Back to main.

---

## Team Governance: Protected Files

A team can mark certain files as **protected** — files that should not be overridden by personal sources or forked for customization. Put this in the team registry's `csaw.yml`:

```yaml
csaw:
  protected:
    - AGENTS.md
    - rules/security.md

backend:
  include:
    - AGENTS.md
    - rules/**
```

When a file is protected:

- **Priority is bypassed.** If personal has priority 100 and team's `AGENTS.md` is protected, team's version wins regardless.
- **Fork is refused.** `csaw fork team/AGENTS.md --into personal` returns an error.
- **Protection is visible.** `csaw inspect` marks protected files with a `*` under the source.

Protection is **advisory within csaw** — it prevents csaw's own mechanisms from bypassing team rules. A developer can still manually delete a symlink and write their own file in its place. csaw doesn't try to stop that. This is an open-source tool, not an enterprise MDM.

> Future work: content-hash verification. csaw could record the SHA of each protected file at mount time and detect if someone replaces the symlink with a modified copy. `csaw check --strict` would fail the check. This isn't built yet — filed as tech debt.

## Forking a Team File

You like the team's `AGENTS.md` but want to customize it. Fork it:

```bash
csaw fork team/AGENTS.md --into personal
```

This copies the file to your personal registry. Since personal has higher priority, your version gets mounted instead of the team's. The team original is untouched.

---

## Switching Profiles

Mounting a new profile **replaces** the previous one automatically:

```bash
csaw mount --profile team/backend
# ... working on backend ...

csaw mount --profile team/frontend
# previous mount removed, frontend mounted
```

To go back to what you had before:

```bash
csaw mount --restore
```

To add files on top of an existing mount without replacing:

```bash
csaw mount --keep --profile personal/extras
```

---

## Clean Removal

```bash
csaw unmount
```

Every symlink is removed. If csaw stashed any original files during mount (because they existed before), they're restored. Your project is exactly as it was.

```
✔ 6 removed · 2 restored

  Remount: csaw mount --restore
```

---

## Where Files Get Mounted

csaw knows the four pillars of AI tool configuration and projects each to the right place:

```
Registry path           Project path                     What it is
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AGENTS.md               AGENTS.md                        Project guidance (the standard)
rules/go.md             .claude/rules/go.md              Always-on coding standards
                        .cursor/rules/go.md
agents/reviewer.md      .claude/agents/reviewer.md       Subagent definitions
                        .cursor/agents/reviewer.md
skills/foo/SKILL.md     .claude/skills/foo/SKILL.md      On-demand reusable workflows
                        .agents/skills/foo/SKILL.md
mcp/claude-code.json    .mcp.json                        Tool/data connectivity
```

You write files once in your registry. csaw projects them into every tool's native directory.

Mounted files are hidden from git via `.git/info/exclude`. Use `csaw show <path>` to make one visible, `csaw hide <path>` to hide it.

---

## Configuring Tools

On first mount, csaw asks which AI tools you use:

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Which AI tools do you use?              │
│                                          │
│  ● Claude Code                           │
│  ● Cursor                                │
│  ○ OpenCode                              │
│  ○ Codex                                 │
│  ○ Windsurf                              │
│                                          │
│  space toggle · enter confirm            │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

This is saved to `~/.csaw/config.yml` and applies to all projects. You can also set it directly:

```bash
csaw config set tools claude,cursor
```

---

## Registry Structure

A csaw source is just a git repo with markdown files:

```
my-ai-config/
  csaw.yml              ← profiles (which files to mount)
  .csawignore           ← files hidden from default mounts
  AGENTS.md             ← project guidance (the standard)
  rules/                ← always-on coding standards
    go-conventions.md
    testing-standards.md
  agents/               ← subagent definitions (separate context windows)
    code-reviewer.md
    planner.md
  skills/               ← on-demand reusable workflows
    code-review/
      SKILL.md
    testing/
      SKILL.md
    experimental/       ← work in progress (hidden by .csawignore)
      new-idea/
        SKILL.md
  mcp/                  ← MCP server configs
    claude-code.json
```

Every file is standard markdown — usable with or without csaw.

### Profiles

Profiles go in `csaw.yml`. They define which files to mount:

```yaml
backend:
  description: Go backend development
  include:
    - AGENTS.md
    - agents/go.md
    - skills/code-review/**
    - skills/testing/**

frontend:
  extends: backend
  include:
    - agents/react.md
    - skills/react-patterns/**
```

Profiles support glob patterns and inheritance. `extends` pulls in everything from the parent.
